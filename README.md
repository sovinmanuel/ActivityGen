# Abstract of Thesis

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enables the creation of bots that automate time-consuming tasks in applications that exhibit repetitive patterns. Process Mining (PM) techniques help identify such patterns and develop better bots by analyzing interaction logs that capture user interaction with the mouse and contain screenshots for each interaction, which captures the state of the desktop. However, the interaction logs can not be directly used to apply PM techniques, and they have to be transformed into a suitable format, namely event logs. Translucent event logs have been proposed as a new format, an extension of event logs containing information about enabled activities extracted from the screenshots. Dedicated PM techniques for translucent event logs outperform traditional ones on event logs, thereby helping improve RPA initiatives. However, current techniques for extracting enabled activities rely on template matching, which leads to unreliable detection. Moreover, no approach exists for creating translucent event logs based on interaction logs automatically, and a manual creation would be time-consuming, as every enabled activity depicted on the screenshots has to be manually extracted. Therefore, we propose ActivityGen, a modular framework with optional user guidance for automatically extracting enabled activities from screenshots, allowing translucent event logs to be created. First, components in a screenshot are detected and classified using Computer Vision (CV) techniques and Machine Learning (ML). After that, these components are filtered on relevancy and associated with an activity name using a generated expressive label conveying the user interaction. We evaluate ActivityGen extensively in quantitative and qualitative aspects regarding detecting components and generating labels for the activities. We present a case study using a real-life workflow that showcases the promising results of ActivityGen.
